# README

* Please be aware that I've developed it on Windows.
* So that there is a rake task with references to json files with C:\...\files\
* Also I've added the ~create_db.bat that prepares the db tables and also migrates 
the data from the two json files into the db using the import.rake task.

* After everything is ready you just go to 
http://localhost:3000
click on link and see the map.
* Also if you have no time to install this, see the screenshots under the /gett/screenshots
